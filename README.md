**Notes:**
* this only completes the two-player game (I've spent enough time on something orignally in an optional section)
* I don't fully like the design--I think a judge/RulesKeeper class could be used to help the Grid class shoulder some of the burden. I'm not sure the Grid should be responsible for deteriming winners.
