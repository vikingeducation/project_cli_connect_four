######### 1. The Vertical
-> Test each column for four of the same in a row ("X" or "O")
-> If they're building from top to bottom
-> if the starting point is position 3, then it's impossible

###### RULES #######
1. Any column can have a vertical win.
2. Only rows 0-2 cam have a vertical win.
2. Only columns 0-3 can have have a horizontal win
3. Any row can have a horizonal win.
4. Diagonals can go bottom left to top right or top left to bottom right. 
5. They still have up for rows worth, so diagonals can only happen from columns 0-3
6. top to bottom can only happen from rows 3-5
7. bottom to top can only happen from rows 0-2
8. If there's been a set number of turns and a winner hasn't been found, then it's a draw.
