# # Your code here!

# # Each player is prompted for their move in turn and asked where to drop their piece
# A player wins if their last drop resulted in four-in-a-row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally
# players cannot specify a drop position that's out of bounds
# players cannot specify a drop position that's already filled to the top
# the game is a draw if the board fills without a winner

# Player
# - move (class or method?)
# - drop (Piece, column)

# Board
# - Piece (class or property?)
#   - has color
# - 7 columns, max at 6 pieces high (full goes here?)
# - full
# - add piece

# Piece
# - color

# Game
# - match draw (when board full)
# - win condition
# - player turn logic

# Piece.new(player='player', column)
